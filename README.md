Metroid: Warp Mission (mzm teleporting thing). Currently in super alpha mega remix edition.

Install
=======

Installation follows the basic CMake install procedure.

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`

Or using the GUI (I won't include instructions on how to use a GUI. If you need help with that, you probably shouldn't be here).
