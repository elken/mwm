Metroid: Warp Mission (mzm teleporting thing). Currently in super alpha mega remix edition.

Build
=======

Building follows the basic CMake install procedure.

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`

Or using the GUI (I won't include instructions on how to use a GUI. If you need help with that, you probably shouldn't be here).


Or use Visual Studio, although you'll probably need to change the paths for wxWidgets.


What's going on?
================

This is just a placeholder for now, I need to attach an explanation either here or on a Github pages site.
